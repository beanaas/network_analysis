Unused:
* Gaussian_data.py: example with synthetic multivariate Gaussian data
* generate_Gaussian_example.py: generate a sparse covariance for the Gaussian example

Make sure to run the download-US-congress-votes.py on the same machine
that the lab will be run on, because the file format is incompatible
between some versions of Python.
